# Audio Recorder and Player
In this project we designed an audio recorder and player by using TM4C123 Microcontroller unit and peripherals such as 
Microphone, Potentiometer, Digital to Analog Converter, Audio Amplifier and Speaker modules.

The project mainly consists of 2 parts which are recording the audio and playing it in a loop. 
These parts do not have to be synchronous meaning that audio playing can be after the recording has been done.

Sampling frequency is 8kHz while playback frequency can be adjusted 
( Between 4kHz - 16kHz )on the fly by changing the input from potentiometer.

Startup File is provided by Texas Instruments.
